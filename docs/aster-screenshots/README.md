# Actual Aster simulator captures

These unmodified screenshots come from [GitHub run 38083870485](https://github.com/omarkebrit/-HarborBrowser-/actions/runs/38083870485), source `51fe284ead04c0d17b55c51725aa590dd951d031`, on an iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator running iOS 26.5. These are actual test fixtures and UI, not design mockups.

[Run 15 preflight gallery](regression-run15/README.md) contains five newer verified fullscreen and tab-restoration captures with separate provenance.

In the depicted run, the preflight passed all four cases and the main selection passed 14/15; its immediate post-rotation toolbar assertion failed. Run 15's newer gallery retains its passing four-case checkpoint, including 25-tab creation/restoration. Run 16 passed the three media cases but failed waiting for tab 7's document to exist, before visibility checks. [Run 17](https://github.com/omarkebrit/-HarborBrowser-/actions/runs/38410673448), source `6d8eec264d4eaafea4eaed6bd2ff919e0005f7f8`, is launched with a scoped document-readiness change; its required results remain unverified. These images retain their original source provenance and do not certify signed installation, every website, complete Arabic translation or physical-device audio. See [the validation report](../../TEST-REPORT.md).
